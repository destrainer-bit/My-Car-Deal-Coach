# 🤖 AI Agent Setup Guide

## Current Status: **PARTIALLY CONNECTED** ⚠️

The GPT agent is built and integrated but needs API key configuration to work fully.

## ✅ What's Already Working:

1. **Agent Infrastructure**: Complete OpenAI integration system
2. **UI Components**: Multiple agent panels in Settings page
3. **Demo Mode**: Shows how the agent works without API key
4. **Local Agent**: Client-side AI processing ready

## 🔧 To Enable Full AI Functionality:

### 1. Get OpenAI API Key
- Go to https://platform.openai.com
- Create account and get API key
- Add credits to your account

### 2. Configure Environment
Add to your `.env.local` file:
```bash
VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
```

### 3. Test the Agent
- Go to Settings page in the app
- Find "Personal Negotiator Agent" section
- Enter a negotiation goal
- Click "Run Step" to test

## 🎯 Agent Features:

- **Negotiation Strategy**: Analyzes deals and provides tactics
- **Fee Detection**: Identifies junk fees and add-ons
- **Script Generation**: Creates negotiation scripts
- **Step-by-Step Guidance**: Breaks down complex negotiations

## 📍 Where to Find the Agent:

1. **Settings Page**: `/app/settings` - Personal Negotiator Agent section
2. **Shell Component**: Sidebar with agent access
3. **Multiple Panels**: Simple, Negotiator, and Mock versions

## 🚀 Current Demo Mode:

The agent currently shows demo responses to demonstrate functionality. Once you add the API key, it will provide real AI-powered negotiation assistance.

## 🔍 Testing:

1. Open the app at `http://localhost:5173`
2. Navigate to Settings
3. Scroll to "Personal Negotiator Agent"
4. Enter a goal like "Get OTD for Honda Civic ≤ $25,000"
5. Click "Run Step" to see the agent work

The agent is **ready to use** - just needs the API key! 🎉
